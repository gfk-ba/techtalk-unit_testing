		\item It's hard to write unit tests for a unit.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Unit design issue.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Mocking/faking/spying of functions of the unit being tested.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item The test subject is modified to prove it works. Something's definitely wrong.
			\item Unit design issue or error in unit test.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Non-public interface is being tested.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Probable cause: There is a separate unit hidden inside the unit being tested.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Unit depends on state outside of itself.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Either refactor the unit using dependency injection,
			\item Or choose the bigger unit to write the unit tests against.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Inspecting the value of non-public properties.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Don't!
			\item Just don't!

	\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
		\item Mocking/Faking instances not managed by the testing code.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Create abstraction of the instance class using interfaces.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Unit functions are tested individually, instead of combined.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item In case the functions don't operate on shared state: refactor the unit by splitting it up in smaller units.
			\item Otherwise: probably non-public properties are inspected.
			\item Write unit tests that test/demonstrate the behavior of (sequentially) invoking a combination of the unit's functions. Because this public behavior is the unit's contract with its clients and therefore \alert{should be tested}.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Changes in the unit source code are needed to support unit testing.
		\begin{itemize}[<+-| highlight@+>]
			\item Don't!
			\item Probably non-public behavior is being tested.
		\end{itemize}
